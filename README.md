# Final-Year-Project

Overview:
This project quantified the uncertainty in automated estimates of hippocampal volume, a key Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
(AD) biomarker. A range of hippocampal volume estimates were extracted from MRI scans according to
the labeling of different automatic segmentation models. The variability in the volume estimates was characterized by assessing a range of
statistical evaluation and similarity metrics.
